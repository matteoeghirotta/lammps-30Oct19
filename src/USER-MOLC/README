This package implements the MOLC force field for coarse grained simulations of
aspherical particles, as described in the paper:

reversible Coarse Grained approach using anisotropic beads for the
modelling of organic functional materials, PCCP, 21, 26195 -
26211(2019) DOI: 10.1039/c9cp04120f (2019)

It allows to perform simulations of collections of Gay-Berne particles linked
together in coarse-grained molecules by bonds, constraining all relevant degrees
of freedom, hence ellipsoidal orientations and relative positions, apart from
distance.

It also provides classes to take into account short and long range electrostatic
interactions of collections of point charges distributed in the interior of the
ellipsoidal beads.

Both additions to lammps, together with the already implemented pair_style
gayberne for van der waals interactions, make it possible to simulate the
dynamics of coarse grained particles modeling very accurately full atom systems.
